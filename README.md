Hello,

While working on this task, I didn't focus much on the UI, but rather placed all my focus on its functionality.

In this task, I stored all the data in the React state and prevented the default behavior of form submission using e.preventDefault() to ensure that the data stored in the state remains saved in the React state and doesn't get lost upon page reload.

While creating this task, I took some help from ChatGPT as I was having trouble figuring out the logic for updating the TODOs.

I hope you will like this Task 02 as well.

Regards,
Rehan Sandali
Thanks
